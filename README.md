## Purpose

These are simple tools for tasks I find annoying and repetetive.

There are a few audio or video related tools. I do lots with
video and audio files and most of the tools in the ecosystem are
cumbersome to deal with since they tend to give
either way too much detail or are hard to script with. This
matters when you have thousands of files to process.

There are some things here to provide simple, on-instance
details for scripting DevOps solutions for cloud servers.

## Installers

 * install-dev-environment.sh - 
 Provides a consistent environment for working. The installer
 adds various tools like docker. Read the source for full
 package install details.
 
 Installers generally drop an install.LOG into /root
